		<h2>About Kousei Arima:</h2>
		<p>Kousei Arima is the main character from the anime <strong>"Your lie in April"</strong> which is one of the greatest and saddest anime ever known. Kousei is a pianist who was the youngest winner of "Maihou Piano Competition"

So he wasn't allowed to go out much. And had to play 8 hours everyday on the piano since he was forced, and get beat up if he made a mistake while playing, this has affected Kousei a lot and made him antisocial and the sudden death of kousei's mom made him more depressed to the point that he hasn't play the piano for two years after the incident, so he hated music and didn't want to play piano anymore..</p>


		<h2>The Story:</h2>
		<p>Koari Myazono had some health issues when she was young. a doctor told Koari's parents that she was about to die. But her parents wanted to keep it secret from Kaori so she doesn't panic, but she found out about her health issues. So she became more free-spirited, both as a person and in her music in order to not have any regrets when she dies. </p>
		<p>Kaori was amazed by Arima's playing when she was five. and she was inspired to play the violon so that she could one day play with him, and since she realized that she didnt have much time left to live so wanted to achieve that dream. <br>
		One day Kousei was taking a walk and he saw a 14 year old girl playing the melodica and was amazed by her playing. she was Myazono, the person who changed kousei's life completely. That's how the story begins! </p>
